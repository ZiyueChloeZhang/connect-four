# Connect Four

## Overview

Users are able to:

- View the game rules
- Play a game of Connect Four against another human player (alternating turns on the same computer)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- See the discs animate into their position when a move is made

## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - JS testing
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- what pure functions are and how to write them in ES6
- test driven development for the business logic using Jest
- grid layout for displaying discs
- animation with css
- mixins in scss
- responsive layout

### Continued development

- add options to play against a computer
- extract business logic into a set of apis (possibly in Haskell? functional programming is fun)
- support play with players online
